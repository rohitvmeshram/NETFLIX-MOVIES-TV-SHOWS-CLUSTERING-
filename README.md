# NETFLIX-MOVIES-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING-
Netflix is a company that manages a large collection of TV shows and movies, streaming it anytime via online. This business is profitable because users make a monthly payment to access the platform. However, customers can cancel their subscriptions at any time. 
Therefore, the company must keep the users hooked on the platform and not lose their interest. This is where recommendation systems start to play an important role, providing valuable suggestions to users is essential.

Netflix Recommender recommends Netflix movies and TV shows based on a user's favourite movie or TV show. It uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and a K-Means Clustering model to make these recommendations. These models use information about movies and TV shows such as their plot descriptions and genres to make suggestions. The motivation behind this project is to develop a deeper understanding of recommender systems and create a model that can perform Clustering on comparable material by matching text-based attributes. Specifically, thinking about how Netflix create algorithms to tailor content based on user interests and behavior.
